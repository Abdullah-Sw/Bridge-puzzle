# Bridge-puzzle
Problem description:<br>
A group of K persons (K > 1) want to cross a bridge from East to West during the
night. The persons that are crossing the bridge must use a flashlight. There is only
one flashlight. The bridge is very narrow and allows two persons to cross
it at the same time at most. Two persons go from east to west and one person returns with
the flashlight from west to east. If the two persons are crossing the bridge together,
they are crossing it at the speed of the slower one. These people are trying to cross
the bridge as quickly as possible.
We will Use 3 search strategies (UCS, IDS and A*) to find the best order for these persons to cross the bridge.<br><br>

1- Uniform cost search<br>
2- iterative deepening search<br>
3- A* search<br>
We used heuristic function for A*<br>
The objective of the program is to display the solution, solution cost, search cost and space requirement.<Br>
